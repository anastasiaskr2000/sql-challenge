# sql-challenge

As a new data engineer at a fictional company Pewlett Hackard, my first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. 
All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, I will design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data.
I will perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.
